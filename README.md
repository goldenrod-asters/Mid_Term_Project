# Data Analytics: Mid-Term Project

## Team:
Olga Gnezdilova<br>
Olivia Ihuoma Ojinji-Kotschka<br>
Flora Kwong<br>

## Business Case:
Job seekers do not know what salaries they can expect based on existing tools and do not know how to begin salary negotiations with recruiters.

## Goal:
Deliver predictions on what salaries job seekers can expect/negotiate with<br>

## Description of the dataset:
1. Table of data science jobs from 2020-2023: https://github.com/Oliviasteph5/Mid_Term_Project/commit/03f47ede8baeabf674468d66b98fdb2d9dc2c010
 - majority of jobs are based in the US, a few European countries, and misc.
 - relatively well structured, with salaries already translated into USD
2. Table of data science jobs 2024 â€“ potentially vertically joined with first table: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kuralamuthan300/glassdoor-data-science-jobs
 - majority of jobs again based in the US
 - fewer columns than Table 1, will need to explore which variables we need
 
### Columns in Table 1:
- Work year
- Experience level
- Employment type
- Job title
- Salary (in original currency)
- Denomination of original currency
- Salary in USD
- Residence of the employee
